## Integration of Genomic Data Revealing a Key Role of Transcriptional Pausing in Genome Instability

This repository contains all the figures and scripts I produced during my Master's internship in the **Cuvier Lab**, led by **Olivier Cuvier**.

The objective of this project was to explore the relationship between **transcriptional pausing** and **genome stability** using various types of omics data such as **ChIP-seq**, **RNA-seq**, and **DRIP-seq**.

- The figures and scripts included in my internship report are located in the `Figures/` folder.
- Additional figures and scripts generated during the internship are available in the `Additional_figures/` folder.
